The serum digoxin level of two of our chronic heart failure patients who were not taking digoxin was accidentally measured and was reported as 0.21 and 0.22 ng/ml. These patients were not taking medications that may interfere with digoxin assays. (The medications of Patient 1 included metoprolol, perindopril and acenocoumarol while Patient 2 received bisoprolol, perindopril, indapamide, allopurinol, doxazosin, potassium chloride and acenocoumarol). Neither of these patients had signs or symptoms of cardiac decompensation and both were female. They reported to have consumed the same fruit tea on a daily basis (Pickwick Fruit Amour Gyümölcstea Variációk II, Sara Lee International) (filter tea: 2 g/filter). This tea was a collection of different tea mixtures whose common ingredients were hibiscus flower and rose hip. We presume that the consumption of fruit tea may be responsible for the interaction. Consequently, we prepared a brew containing the patient's tea and a rose hip-hibiscus tea mix (Pickwick Rose hip tea with hibiscus, Sara Lee Intl.; filter tea (2.5 g/filter), ingredients: rose hip/hibiscus, 60/ 40%). Teas used here and in subsequent experiments were brewed by adding two tea filters or two tea spoons of dried material to 250 ml of|B|0_7|B|{S}
hot water, unless stated otherwise. These brews were then tested without further dilution using digoxin assays from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany) on a Cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). This test employs the electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) method. The apparent digoxin levels of the teas consumed by the patients and of the rose hip-hibiscus tea were 0.33 and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively. Brews made from the same tea mixtures (1 filter/100 ml water) were tested using the HPLC–MS (high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) method, and contamination with digoxin was excluded. In a second experiment, we measured the digoxin level in two different brands of rose-hip/hibiscus tea mixes (Pickwick, Sara Lee Intl. and Naturland Magyarország Kft., Budapest) as well as in a hibiscus tea (hibiscus flower, Juvapharma Kft.) using ECLIA (Table 1). The following digoxin levels were reported: 0.514 ng/ml, 0.522 ng/ml and 0.31 ng/ml.|B|0_8|B|{S}

Using the Abbott Digoxin II assay (microparticle enzyme immu- noassay (MEIA) on an AxSYM immunoassay analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) and the Immulite 2000 Digoxin assay (EURO/DPC Ltd., UK) on an Immulite 2000 (Siemens Healthcare, Munich, Germany) immunoassay analyzer, the digoxin level was not detectable in the brews above. Using ECLIA only, we also examined a pure rose-hip brew (Naturland Magyarország Kft., Budapest), in which the apparent digoxin level was reported as 0.488 ng/ml. In our third experiment, we prepared a serum pool of the samples sent for digoxin level determination. The samples used were no longer suited for diagnostic testing, as specified by local protocols. The digoxin level of this serum pool was reported as 1.6 ng/ml (Table 1). Then we prepared a 1:1 mixture of the brews used in the second experiment (with the exception of the pure rose-hip tea) and the serum pool, as well as a 1:1 mixture of the serum pool and the universal diluent used for digoxin level measurement. We determined the digoxin level (ECLIA) of these mixtures (Table 1). Significant in vitro interference [1] was detected when the 1:1 mixture was made of a tea brew from a mixture of rose-hip and hibiscus and human serum (Table 1). Numerous flavonoids and their glycosides can be detected in the extracts of hibiscus flower and rose-hip [2–4]. Consequently, we performed a fourth experiment using different dilutions of commercially available flavonoids with distilled water as diluent (Table 2). The concentrationsof thecyanidinchlorideand delphinidin chloridedilutions used were 1000, 500, 250,125, 63 μg/ml. Catechin hydrate was diluted to a concentration of 1000 and 500 μg/ml. Taxifolin hydrate, quercetin and avicularin were only tested in a concentration of 500 μg/ml. Using the ECLIA method, apparent digoxin level was detectable in the following dilutions: delphinidin chloride of 1000, 500, 250, 125 μg/ml, cyanidin chloride of 1000, 500, 250 μg/ml and quercetin of 500 μg/ml (Table 2). In summary, we have shown that hibiscus flower and rose-hip found in the teas consumed by our patients may be responsible for the false positive digoxin test results. It is likely that the flavonoids (delphinidin, cyaniding and their glycosides, as well as quercetin) detected in our experiments have a role in this cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity was seen using the ECLIA method but not using the Abbott Digoxin II (MEIA) and the Immulite Digoxin assays. Based on the information obtained from the manufacturer, the targets of the monoclonal antibodies in the Roche digoxin assay (ECLIA) are the B, C and D rings of the steroid frame. We presume that the flavonoid ring is at least partially responsible for the observed cross-reactivity.|B|1_0|B|{S}
We showed a significant in vitro interference in 1:1 mixtures of rose-hip/hibiscus flower brews and sera containing digoxin (Table 1). If this also happens in vivo, then the recently recommended [5] therapeutic drug levels (0.5–0.8 ng/ml) may be reported incorrectly. Obviously, this set of experiments could not establish the exact mechanisms of cross-reactivity. The limitations of interference testing are also recognized. Properties of the compounds added to a serum pool may be different from those of the compounds circulating in vivo. Our study, however, showed an interaction that can be explained to some extent by the presumed interaction with the flavonoid ring and may influence clinical decision making when managing heart failure patients.|B|1_1|B|{S}
